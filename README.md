# PHP-Contact-Form
The PHP Code which captures and Emails your website form
The PHP code below is very basic - it will capture the form fields specified in the HTML form above (first_name, last_name, email, telephone and comments). The fields are then sent off to your email address in plain text.

Note: You need to edit 2 parts of the script below. You need to tell it your email address (this will not be available for anyone to see, it is only used by the server to send your email). You can also specify an email subject line (or just leave the one which is there).

File Name: send_form_email.php (you must use this filename exactly)
